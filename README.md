# Capture-the-Flag-CTF-Penetration-Testing-for-Rekall-Corporation
I participated in a Capture the Flag (CTF) competition designed to apply offensive security skills acquired during my cybersecurity training. The project involved a simulated penetration testing engagement for a fictional organization, Rekall Corporation. I worked in a team to identify and exploit vulnerabilities across the various systems.

# Overview
Collaborated with a team to conduct a comprehensive penetration test on Rekall Corporation's web application, Linux servers, and Windows servers. Utilized various exploitation techniques to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, including Nmap, Nessus, and Metasploit, successfully capturing multiple flags as part of a competitive CTF environment. Developed a detailed penetration testing summary report documenting findings and recommendations for enhancing security posture.

# Key Highlights:

Day 1: Focused on exploiting vulnerabilities in Rekall's web application, successfully uncovering multiple flags through techniques such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Day 2: Shifted to identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in Linux servers, enhancing my skills in system hardening and security auditing.

Day 3: Explored vulnerabilities in Windows servers, applying knowledge of penetration testing tools and methodologies.

This hands-on experience not only strengthened my technical skills in cybersecurity but also improved my ability to work collaboratively in a team environment, simulate real-world security challenges, and effectively communicate findings.
